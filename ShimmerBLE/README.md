# Shimmer C# BLE API (Alpha Release)

## Current Limitations
### Verisense Pairing Key
When using the verisense device you will require knowing what the pairing key is and updating the [code](https://github.com/ShimmerEngineering/Shimmer-C-API/blob/VCBA-96/ShimmerBLE/VerisenseBLEDemoApp/VerisenseBLEDemoApp/VerisenseBLEDemoApp/VerisenseBLEDemoApp/Advance/VerisenseBLEPairingKeyGenerator.cs) to use said key. Typically you will be allowed to specify whether you want to use the default passkey of 123456 on purchase. Should you have any inquiries contact support. 

### Android
- requires the use of VS 2019 we've had compatibility issues with VS 2022

### IOS
- requires the use of iOS 15, due to issues setting the MTU
- ~~requires the use of VS 17.0.0, we've had compatibility issues~~ in order to support VS >17.0.0 we've had to circumvent a [problem](https://developercommunity2.visualstudio.com/t/XamariniOS-getting-FoundationMonoTouch/1610258?space=8) by [updating](https://github.com/ShimmerEngineering/xamarin-bluetooth-le/tree/shimmer_dev) and compiling new dlls for iOS
- note that the uuid value for a sensor on UWP/Android vs iOS is different, you can typically retrieve the uuid using any common bluetooth scanning app. We recommend either using nrfconnect or https://github.com/xabre/xamarin-bluetooth-le
- note that uuid value for the same sensor on different iOS devices can be different
- to retrieve the uuid on iOS an app such as Blue - Bluetooth & developers can be used to retrieve the uuid as highlighted below

### Binary File Parsing
For solutions to parse your binary files please get in touch with us, at the moment the release of a binary file open source solution is not on our roadmap. 

### Examples
While not provided at the moment it is on our roadmap to provide the following examples
- ble manager (e.g. scanning, and ble auto pairing where applicable (uwp and android))
- s3 cloud manager (e.g. to upload the binary files to the cloud)
